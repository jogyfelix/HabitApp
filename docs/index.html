  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to LoopLog. Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle, store, and protect your information when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>LoopLog does not collect or store personal information on its own servers. All habit and routine data you create is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
  <p>To maintain and improve app quality, we use trusted third-party services such as Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics. These tools may collect anonymized technical information such as device type, operating system, app version, and error logs. No personally identifiable information (PII) is intentionally collected by these services.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because your data is stored locally, its security depends on your deviceâ€™s security measures (e.g., password, encryption, backup settings). We strongly recommend enabling device-level protections. LoopLog is not responsible for data loss, unauthorized access, or security breaches that occur on your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. Limited anonymized technical data collected by Firebase may be used to improve app functionality.</p>

  <h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>The habits, routines, or notes you create within the app are your sole responsibility. LoopLog is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or consequences of any information you choose to record. This app is intended as a personal productivity tool and is not a substitute for medical, psychological, financial, or professional advice.</p>

  <h2>7. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>LoopLog is provided "as is," without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including reliance on data you enter or loss of stored information.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted within the app and/or on our official website or GitHub Pages site. Continued use of the app after changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please reach out at <a href="mailto:jogyfelix1@gmail.com">jogyfelix1@gmail.com</a>.</p>
